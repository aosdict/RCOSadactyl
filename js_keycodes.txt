In all functions that handle a keyboard event, it will have a parameter "event". This is a KeyboardEvent object.

Its member "event.which" holds the keycode, which is usually the ASCII representation of the character pressed without the shift key.

So pressing Shift+5, which normally enters a %, will not give you keycode 37. Instead, the function will be triggered twice, once for Shift (16), and once for 5 (53). The keycode 37 may instead be triggered for some random non-ASCII key (Left Arrow in this case).

For letters, you get the ASCII value of the capital letter. So pressing
'p' will have code 80 'P' rather than 112 'p'.

Special keycodes for non-ASCII keys (and some ASCII ones that are different):
Shift = 16
Caps Lock = 20
Control = 17
Option/Alt = 18
Command = 224
Escape = 27
Enter = 13
Backspace = 8
Left, Up, Right, Down = 37, 38, 39, 40
F1-F8 = 112-119
Backtick/tilde = 192
Minus/underscore = 173
Left bracket/brace = 219
Pipe/backslash = 220
Right bracket/brace = 221
Quote = 222
Comma = 188
Period = 190
Slash/question mark = 191
