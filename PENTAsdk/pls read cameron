Loads a text box at the bottom of the window.
So far, only closes and restarts firefox.

        get_text.js
        text_entry.html
    lib:
        main.js
        
text_entry.html is just the white text box with the black border at the bottom of the screen
get_text.js just parses user input from the box generated in text_entry.html
main.js is where all the funtionality currently is (so far i only wrote code for ":q" to quit firefox and ":r" to restart)

Use this to install the SDK:

And this to learn how to use it:

I would write code, save it, and with a single "cfx run" command, my changes are live. 

It's really similar to everything we've been doing so far except we import XUL modules much differently, like this:

It's easier, everything is bootstrapped for us.  I think we should go down this route and take pentadactyl out of XULrunner already.
