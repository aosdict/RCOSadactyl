We need to decide which key mappings we want to take from VI and translate them into Firefox. 
The Pentadactyl reference is at 5digits.org/help/pentadactyl
One of many vi cheat sheets is at http://www.lagmonster.org/docs/vi2.html

I propose that we follow Pentadactyl's command structure, but if there is a simpler or more intuitive way to do something we do it that way. For example, it would be good if we can cut back on the number of Ctrl+Something commands.

Pentadactyl has several Modes of operation.
Normal Mode - normal browsing with nothing special going on
Command Mode - what you get when you enter a : character. From here, the text entry window is in focus and you can type in extended commands.
Hints Mode - "navigation" mode. When first activated, all links are highlighted. Then you type in some characters and links whose contents do not match are filtered out. Once you uniquely match the link, you hit Enter to follow that link.
